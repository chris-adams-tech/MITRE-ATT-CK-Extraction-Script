# Bandwidth Hijacking (attack-pattern--718cb208-6446-4572-a2f0-9c799c60091e)

## Description
Adversaries may leverage the network bandwidth resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability. 

Adversaries may also use malware that leverages a system's network bandwidth as part of a botnet in order to facilitate [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498) campaigns and/or to seed malicious torrents.(Citation: GoBotKR) Alternatively, they may engage in proxyjacking by selling use of the victims' network bandwidth and IP address to proxyware services.(Citation: Sysdig Proxyjacking) Finally, they may engage in internet-wide scanning in order to identify additional targets for compromise.(Citation: Unit 42 Leaked Environment Variables 2024)

In addition to incurring potential financial costs or availability disruptions, this technique may cause reputational damage if a victimâ€™s bandwidth is used for illegal activities.(Citation: Sysdig Proxyjacking)
